# Heated Insert Press

![Heated Insert Press in Use](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/890fffa0-00b5-42b8-917f-83aabe8aeca2)

## Overview

This project is a custom-built heated insert press designed to make installing heat-set inserts into 3D printed parts easier, more precise, and more consistent. It features a smooth linear motion system, allowing for perfectly straight and controlled insertion of brass threaded inserts.

## Features

- Smooth linear roller action for precise insert placement
- Modular design using common hardware
- Counterweighted system for effortless operation
- Compatible with standard soldering irons and heat-set installation tips
- Built using 2020 aluminum extrusion and 3D printed parts

## How It Works

1. The soldering iron is clamped to an arm and bolted to a roller carriage.
2. The carriage moves smoothly up and down the 2020 aluminum extrusion using ball bearings and wheels.
3. A counterweight system makes pressing down and lifting effortless.
4. A T-Nut acts as an end stop to prevent the tip from hitting the platform.
5. The wooden platform is secured to a 3D printed bracket attached to the 2020 extrusion.

## Benefits

- Ensures perfectly straight inserts every time
- Ideal for small production runs or frequent insert installations
- Increases durability of 3D printed parts by adding metal threads
- Allows for easy disassembly without wearing out threads

## Required Components

- 2020 Aluminum Extrusion
- M4 button head screws
- M4 Slim T-Nuts
- Ball bearings and wheels for the carriage
- Soldering iron (60W recommended)
- Heat-set installation tips
- 3D printed parts (STL files provided)
- Wood for the base platform
- Paracord and pulley for the counterweight system

## Assembly

Detailed assembly instructions will be provided in the project documentation. The design is modular and can be modified to work with different components if needed.

## Usage

1. Secure your 3D printed part to the wooden platform.
2. Lower the heated tip onto the insert.
3. Apply gentle pressure to melt the plastic and push the insert into place.
4. Allow the insert to cool before removing the part.
