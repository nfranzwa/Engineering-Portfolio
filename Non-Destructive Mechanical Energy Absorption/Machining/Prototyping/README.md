# Two Work Coordinate Offset "Simultaneous" Machining

Polycarbonate squares were waterjet off and placed into custom softjaws to hold both the blank and first operation to reduce operation time. The reason for this approach was to test the limited, low quality shop tools we had to guarantee consistent fits. Once the tools and operations created a satisfactory part, I then moved on to a higher volume approach. The picture below is the workholding approach along with the first and second operation CAM in Fusion360.
