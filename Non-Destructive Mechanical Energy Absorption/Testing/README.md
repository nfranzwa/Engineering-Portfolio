Here is an example of testing the 4x4 chiral structure on a MTS Tensile Tester.
The structure is auxetic due its negative poisson's ratio where putting the structure under a tensile load will stretch it perpendicular to the applied stress and under a compressive load will shrink. In the plot below (only under tensile load), we can see the snap-through mechanism at work as the energy wells slowly work up to a period of high resistance that leads to said snap-throughs. Thus absorbing the energy applied (here being tensile/compressive) without deforming plastically.
