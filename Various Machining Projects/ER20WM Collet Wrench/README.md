### Manufacturing Process
1. **Water Jet Cutting**: 
   - Used water jet technology to cut the general shape of the wrench from raw material
   - Provides high precision and clean edges

2. **Post-Processing**:
   - Grinding: Refined the sides to achieve the desired handle fillet
   - Ensures ergonomic grip and smooth finish

### Final Product
The completed ER20WM collet wrench after manufacturing and post-processing:
