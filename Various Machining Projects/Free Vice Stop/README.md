# CNC Stop System

## Overview

This project presents a custom-designed CNC stop system, engineered to enhance precision and efficiency in CNC machining operations. The system consists of a stop joint, connecting rods, and a clamp strap, working together to provide adjustable and reliable workpiece positioning.

## Components

1. **Stop Joint**: 
   - Custom-machined on a mill
   - Connects the clamp strap to the threaded rod
   - Acts as the central component of the system

2. **Connecting Rods**:
   - Two types: 
     a) Aluminum pipe (from clamp strap to stop joint)
     b) Solid aluminum rod (from stop joint to adjustable threaded rod)
   - Cut using a band saw for precise lengths

3. **Clamp Strap**:
   - OEM component
   - Attaches to the CNC table via a bolt and T-nut

4. **Threaded Rod**:
   - Adjustable component for fine-tuning the stop position
   - OEM part

5. **Hardware**:
   - Bolts, T-nuts: OEM components used for secure attachment to the CNC table

## Assembly

The stop joint is the core component, connecting:
1. The clamp strap (attached to the CNC table) via an aluminum pipe
2. The adjustable threaded rod via a solid aluminum rod

This design allows for both stability and adjustability in positioning the workpiece stop.

## Installation

![Installed System](path_to_installed_image.jpg)

1. Attach the clamp strap to the CNC table using the provided bolt and T-nut
2. Connect the aluminum pipe to the clamp strap and the stop joint
3. Attach the solid aluminum rod to the other end of the stop joint
4. Install the threaded rod for fine adjustment of the stop position

## Usage

1. Install the system on your CNC table as described above
2. Adjust the threaded rod to set the desired stop position for your workpiece
3. Secure your workpiece against the stop for consistent positioning across multiple operations or pieces

## Customization

The modular design of this system allows for easy customization:
- Adjust rod lengths for different table sizes or stop distances
- Modify the stop joint design for specific application needs
